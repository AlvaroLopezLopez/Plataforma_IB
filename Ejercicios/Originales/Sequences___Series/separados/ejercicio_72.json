If she lands on **WIN** then the game ends and Alex has won in turn $1$.\n\nIf she lands on **LOSE** then Ben spins. If he lands on **WIN** then the game ends and Ben has won in turn $1$.\n\nIf they both land on **LOSE** then the game continues into turn $2$.\n\nThe same process repeats until someone lands on **WIN**. Alex always spins first for each new turn.\n\nLet the turn that the game ends be the discrete random variable $T$. Where $T=1,2,3,4,...$.\n\n1. Show that the probability that Alex wins and $T=2$ is $\\displaystyle\\frac{4}{27}$. [2]\n2. Hence complete the missing values in the first four columns of the probability distribution for $T$ when Alex wins.\n\n![AA1170_table](./Sequences & Series_files/AA1170_table.JPEG)\n\n[2]\n\n3. Show that when Alex wins the values of $\\text{P}(T=t)$ form a geometric sequence. [2]\n4. Justify that as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ the sequence has a sum. [1]\n5. Hence show that the probability Alex wins the game is $\\displaystyle\\frac{3}{5}$. [2]\n6. Alex and Ben play the same game 10 times.\n\n   The discrete random variable $W$ is the number of times Alex wins.\n\n   1. Determine the probability that $W$ is within one standard deviation of the mean.    2. Determine the probability that $W$ is larger than $\\mathrm{E}(W)$ given $W$ is within one standard deviation of the mean. [7]\n\nAlex and Ben want to keep playing the same game with only one change. They decide to create a new heptagonal spinner.\n\nThe spinner has $7$ equally sized regions.\n\nEach region must be labelled either **WIN** or **LOSE**.\n\nThey want to label the spinner such that the probability of Alex winning the game is $\\frac{7}{10}$.\n\n7. How **many** of the regions should be labeled **WIN**? You must justify your answer. [5]"
