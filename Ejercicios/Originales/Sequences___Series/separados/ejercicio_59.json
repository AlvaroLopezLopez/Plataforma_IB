Alex chooses his local bank and invests his $16000$ \\$\n   in a savings account that offers an interest rate of $5\\%$ per annum\n   compounded **annually**.\n\n   1. Find the value of Alex's investment after $7$ years, to the\n      nearest hundred dollars.\n   2. Alex reaches his goal after n years, where n is an integer.\n      Determine the value of n. [4]\n2. Julie chooses a different bank and invests her\n   $16000$ \\$ in a savings account that offers an\n   interest rate of $r\\%$ per annum compounded **monthly**, where $r$\n   is set to two decimal places.\n\n   Find the minimum value of $r$ needed for Julie to reach her goal\n   after $10$ years. [3]\n3. Xavier also wants to reach a savings goal of\n   $30000$ \\$. He doesn't trust his local bank so he\n   decides to initially put his money into a safety deposit box where it does not\n   earn any interest. His system is to add more money into the safety\n   deposit box at the end of each year. At the end of each year he will add one third of the amount\n   he added at the end of the previous year.\n\n   1. Show that Xavier will never reach his goal if his initial       deposit into the safety deposit box is $16000$ \\$.    2. Find the amount Xavier needs to initially deposit in order to       reach his goal after $7$ years. Give your answer to the nearest       dollar. [7]"
